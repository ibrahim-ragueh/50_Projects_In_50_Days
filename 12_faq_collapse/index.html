                What is a file?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">A file is a collection of data that is stored on a computer or other device. Files can
                be text, images, sounds, or any combination of these. They can be stored on a computer, a hard drive, or
                some other device. When you open a file, you are actually opening a copy of the data inside the file.
                This copy is called the “file” and it is what you see when you open the file. The file can be opened in
                many different ways. For example, you can open it by clicking on it or by double-clicking on it. The
                file can also be opened by dragging and dropping it onto the screen or by using other methods. When you
                open a file, you are actually opening a copy of the data inside the file.</p>

                What is an operating system?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">An operating system is a collection of software that runs on a computer and provides the
                basic functions of storing and managing information, such as memory, storage devices, and network
                access. The operating system controls how the computer works and how it interacts with other software
                and hardware. For example, an operating system can control the way a computer stores and accesses data,
                such as files and printers. In addition to controlling how the computer works and operating system can
                also provide many other functions, such as security, communication, and user interface. An operating
                system can also be used to develop new software applications.</p>

                What is a class variable?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">A class variable is a variable that is defined in a class and shared by all instances of
                the class. Class variables can be used to store information about an object, such as its name, its
                location in memory, and its state at any given time. Class variables are often used to store information
                that is shared by objects in the same class. For example, a class might have a variable called name that
                is shared by all instances of the class. Class variables are often created with the special keyword
                class.</p>

                What is a programming language?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">A programming language is a computer language designed to facilitate the creation of
                software. It is a set of rules and guidelines that govern the structure and format of computer programs.
                A programming language is typically a high-level language that abstracts away the complexities of
                programming in order to make it easier for programmers to understand and write code. There are many
                different programming languages, including C, C++, Java, and Python. The most popular programming
                languages today are C++ and Java. C++ is a high-level language that abstracts away the complexities of
                programming in order to make it easier for programmers to understand and write code.</p>

                What is an Interface?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">An interface is a way of communicating between two objects. The objects can be software
                or hardware. An interface can be defined in many different ways, but the most common definition is that
                it is a way for one object to talk to another object. This communication can take many different forms,
                such as sending data to the other object, receiving data from the other object, or both. An interface
                can be implemented in many different ways, but the most common way is to use a software class. This
                class defines the interface and then other classes can use this class to implement the interface. When
                an object uses an interface, it is saying that it understands how the interface works and can use it to
                communicate with other objects.</p>
